[00:04.44] Op Shop Lover
[00:10.94] 
[00:09.90] Whoa, you're so careless, you're teaching me to care less
[00:14.38] And leaving me so breathless with your style and stick awareness
[00:46.38] 
[00:18.24] Fools love pretending, we're richer than we are
[00:23.69] Clothes from old grandpas
[00:26.63] And fools love pretending, we're richer than we are
[00:31.98] Still pray that my car starts
[00:46.48] 
[00:35.11] So, how did I get so lucky?
[00:38.07] Hand in hand, in second-hand stuff
[00:40.75] Ooh, you look so lovely
[00:42.46] You're my diamante in the rough
[00:44.82] And you're never fussy
[00:46.65] Love that you love doing nothing
[00:48.93] Let's try on another
[00:51.92] My Op Shop Lover (ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[01:15.42] 
[01:01.94] Scoured every store within this
[01:04.50] Town filled with funny business
[01:06.50] You put me in those dresses
[01:08.22] Laugh at me in public places (haha)
[01:25.72] 
[01:11.22] Life in present tense
[01:13.63] Sleeping in the car
[01:15.69] The back of your Toyota
[01:19.08] Livin' life in present tense
[01:22.47] Sittin' on a fence
[01:24.65] Wondering how it ends
[01:35.15] 
[01:28.40] How did I get so lucky?
[01:30.23] Hand in hand, in second-hand stuff
[01:32.84] Ooh, you look so lovely
[01:34.76] You're my diamante in the rough
[01:37.39] And you're never fussy
[01:39.18] Love that you love doing nothing
[01:41.30] Let's try on another
[01:44.49] My Op Shop Lover
[01:52.49] 
[01:46.26] That's actually you know (woo)
[01:48.34] That's actually you know
[01:49.39] I love that shit, I love it
[02:02.89] 
[01:54.49] Fools love pretending
[01:57.33] We're richer than we are (richer than we, richer than us)
[02:02.90] Fools love pretending (ooh-ooh-ooh)
[02:06.06] We're richer than we are (ooh, ooh-ooh)
[02:25.56] 
[02:12.00] How did I get so lucky?
[02:13.97] Hand in hand, in second-hand stuff
[02:16.59] Ooh, you look so lovely
[02:18.64] You're my diamante in the rough
[02:20.70] And you're never fussy
[02:22.81] Love that you love doing nothing
[02:25.19] Let's try on another
[02:28.01] My Op Shop Lover
